## Why do I study Julia

- Mastered programming languages: 
    - level 2: C(all the time)/Fortran(at CAS)/Matlab(at ETH) 
    - level 1: Go(at ECTEC)/JS(at ECTEC)/C#(at Itasca)
    - level 0: Python(at ETH)/

- Why Julia
    - Julia = C + Fortran + Matlab = a combination of my favors
    - Julia covers my fields: PDE/FEM/HPC/ML and maybe later quantum computing

- Other interested languages:
    - Rust = Go(=C#) + JS (WebAssemblly) 
    - Python = a glue language

## Why do I create this project
From my short time experience (2 days), Julia language is not difficult if you know English. 
However in China, it is really difficult due to the following reasons:

- Too slow for fetching/installing packages (many people will leave at the beginning stage)
- Chinese teaching resources only copy English material, no original analysis
- emmm, many other reasons ...

My motivation is to solve above problems. I gave a private Matlab course in CMA 10 years ago, that repeating the Matlab examples may be quick way to master basic points of Julia. This is why I create this project, to study Julia by coding in practice. 

I hope to understand and use Julia in depth first, and help Chinese students understand and use Julia later. 

## next in Chinese
我的学习和探索经历都会用语雀文档记录下来，一些技巧性的，特别是针对国内网络环境的package安装技巧都会在这里记录。
